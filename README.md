# AC-DC Power Transfer Simulink with Active Front-End Converter
This was a course project designed by me in Power Electronics And Drives course at IIT Delhi.


You can get the overview of the model in the png file or by clicking on this image: https://rhythmshah-04.github.io/DC-Motor-Control/model_view.html


We can check the 3-phase current, grid voltage and DC bus voltage waveforms on changing various tuning parameters and check their performance.

For checking the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), we can change the model settings to run FFT Analyzer for less than 5% presence of other harmonics in grid current. If we get higher value, we need to fine tune the various parameters used in this project.
